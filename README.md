# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This project required us to make a game out of the given source code. There are a bunch of balls bouncing around the screen, and
we were given the task of implementing a user controllable circle
that 'eats' up the balls when the circle makes contact with one of them. There is a 'Ball Count' on the right of the screen
so the player knows how many are left. I've also implemented a 
second CPU controlled circle that helps the player out.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

Once you have the program running, navigate to a browser
to test the page. You should be able to use the WASD keys
to move the white circle around and 'eat up' balls.


## Sources and Credits

The only sources I used we're the required reading documents
as well as the directions given on the assignment page.
