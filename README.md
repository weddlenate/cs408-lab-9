# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This project required us to make a game out of the given source code. There are a bunch of balls bouncing around the screen, and
we were given the task of implementing a user controllable circle
that 'eats' up the balls when the circle makes contact with one of them. There is a 'Ball Count' on the right of the screen
so the player knows how many are left. I've also implemented a 
second CPU controlled circle that helps the player out.

## Sources and Credits

The only sources I used we're the required reading documents
as well as the directions given on the assignment page.
